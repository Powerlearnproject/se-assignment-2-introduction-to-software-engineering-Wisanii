Software Engineering vs. Traditional Programming:
Software Engineering is a collection of techniques,methodologies and tools that help with the production of a high quality software system with a given budget before a
given deadline.It involves the use of methodologies, tools, and techniques to manage the complexity of large-scale software projects, ensuring they meet quality, cost, and time constraints.
Traditional programming, on the other hand, typically refers to the act of writing code to solve a specific problem without necessarily considering broader engineering principles.

Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):

Many different software processes but all involve the following phases (the names of the phases vary from one organisation to another):
1. Requirements – The concept is explored and the client’s needs are elicited.
2. Specification – Requirements are analysed in order determine and define what the system should do;
3. Planning – The software project management plan is developed.
4. Design – defining the organization of the system (Defining how the system will work in solving the problem). 
5. Implementation – Implementing (coding) the designed system;
6. Validation – Checking that it does what the customer wants;
7. Evolution/Maintenance – Changing the system in response to  changing customer needs. The design and the implementation of the system influences the system’s maintainability.
  • Corrective maintenance – Software repair: removing residual faults.
  • Enhancement maintenance – Changes to the system due to requirement changes.

  Agile vs. Waterfall Models:

  Agile: Iterative and incremental approach focusing on flexibility and customer collaboration. 
  Emphasizes delivering working software in short iterations.
  
  The waterfall model :- Plan-driven model. Separate and distinct phases of specification and development.
  It is follows a sequential approach.

Requirements Engineering:

Requirements engineering is the systematic process of gathering, analyzing, documenting, 
and managing software requirements throughout the development lifecycle.
It involves understanding the needs of stakeholders and translating those needs into detailed specifications that guide the design,
implementation, and testing of the software system. The process typically includes:

Elicitation: Engaging with stakeholders to identify their needs, expectations, and constraints.
Techniques such as interviews, surveys, and workshops may be used to gather requirements.

Analysis: Analyzing and prioritizing requirements to ensure they are clear, consistent, and feasible.
This stage involves identifying dependencies, conflicts, and potential risks associated with the requirements.

Specification: Documenting requirements in a clear and unambiguous manner using techniques such as use cases,
user stories, and formal requirement documents. The specification serves as a blueprint for the development team.

Validation: Ensuring that the specified requirements accurately reflect the needs of stakeholders and are feasible to
implement within the project constraints. Validation may involve reviews, prototyping, and user feedback.

Management: Tracking changes to requirements, managing conflicts, and ensuring traceability between requirements and 
other artifacts throughout the development lifecycle.

Requirements engineering is crucial in the software development lifecycle because it forms the foundation for building software
that meets the needs of stakeholders. By accurately capturing and documenting requirements, teams can reduce the risk of project
failure, improve communication among team members and stakeholders, and facilitate alignment between the software solution and the 
business objectives.

Software Design Principles:

Modularity in software design refers to the practice of breaking down a system into smaller, independent components or 
modules, each with a well-defined purpose and clear interfaces for interaction with other modules.

Benefits of Modularity:

Maintainability: Modularity facilitates easier maintenance by isolating changes within specific modules, reducing the risk of 
unintended side effects and making it easier to understand and modify individual components without impacting the entire system.

Scalability: Modular designs are inherently scalable because they allow for the reuse of components across different
parts of the system. As the system grows or evolves, new functionality can be added by extending or combining existing modules
rather than starting from scratch.

Encapsulation: Modules encapsulate their internal implementation details, hiding complexity and reducing dependencies
between different parts of the system. This enhances flexibility and facilitates changes without affecting other modules.

Reuse: Modular designs promote code reuse by enabling developers to leverage existing modules in new contexts or projects, saving
time and effort and promoting consistency and standardization across the codebase.

Testing in Software Engineering:

Software testing is a critical phase in the software development lifecycle aimed at verifying that the software meets 
its specified requirements, functions correctly, and is free from defects. Different levels of testing are performed
at various stages of development to ensure thorough validation and verification of the software.By conducting testing at multiple
levels, software development teams can identify and address defects early in the development process,
ensuring the quality and reliability of the final product.

1. Unit Testing:
    Objective: To test individual components or units of code in isolation.
    Scope: Focuses on verifying the correctness of the smallest testable parts of the software, such as functions, methods, or classes.
    Implementation: Developers write test cases targeting specific functionalities within the unit and execute them using testing frameworks like JUnit (for Java) or pytest (for Python).
    Tools: Unit testing frameworks, mocking libraries, and code coverage tools help automate and streamline the unit testing process.
    Example: Testing a function that calculates the square root of a number to ensure it returns the correct result for different input values.

2. Integration Testing:
    Objective: To verify the interactions and interfaces between integrated components or modules.
    Scope: Focuses on testing the integration points and interactions between different units to ensure they work together as intended.
    Implementation: Test cases are designed to validate data flow, communication protocols, and error handling across integrated components.
    Tools: Integration testing frameworks, stubs, and drivers help simulate the behavior of dependent components during testing.
    Example: Testing the integration between a front-end user interface and a back-end database to ensure data is correctly displayed and stored.

3. System Testing:
   - Objective: To validate the behavior of the entire software system as a whole.
   - Scope: Focuses on testing the system's functionalities, performance, reliability, and compatibility with its environment.

   - Tools: Automated testing tools, load testing tools, and configuration management tools help conduct comprehensive system testing.
   - **Example:** Testing a web application by performing various user actions, such as registration, login, data submission, and navigation across different pages.

4. Acceptance Testing:
   -Objective: To determine whether the software meets the acceptance criteria defined by stakeholders.
   -Scope:Focuses on validating that the software fulfills the business requirements and user expectations.
   -Implementation: Test cases are based on user stories, use cases, or acceptance criteria provided by stakeholders.
   - Tools: Acceptance testing frameworks, user acceptance testing (UAT) environments, and defect tracking systems assist
     in executing and managing acceptance tests.
   - Example: End-users or product owners perform acceptance testing by using the software in a production-like 
     environment to assess its suitability for deployment.
